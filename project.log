What is the training set?
Waht is the data set?

Both answers in important_info.log.

Moving in for the merge now.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Data appears to be in the format of space-seperated values


train/y_train.txt has 7352 rows
train/x_train.txt has 7352 rows 

each row has a bunch of values.  561 to be exact!
Each row is an activity.

I know what I need to do.

First I am going to start off by seeing if I can do everything that I need to do with just the first fifty rows of each file.

I am going to start by merging "vertically" and then trying to merge horizontally.

Starting with the readings vector.
  two steps:
    1.  merge 50 + 100
    2.  statistical transform to stdev and mean



    #VERTICAL MERGES
    setwd("")
    data1 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test_50.txt")
    data2 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train_100.txt")


    data4 = rowSums(data3)
    data4$mean = rowMeans(data3)

    subjects1 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test_50.txt")
    subjects2 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train_100.txt")

    data4 = cbind(data4, subjects3)

    activities1 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test_50.txt")
    activities2 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train_100.txt")
    activities3 = rbind(activities1,activities2)

    data4$stdev = data.frame(apply(data3,1,sd))


    data4$activity[data4$activity == 1] <- "WALKING"
    data4$activity[data4$activity == 2] <- "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
    data4$activity[data4$activity == 3] <- "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
    data4$activity[data4$activity == 4] <- "SITTING"
    data4$activity[data4$activity == 5] <- "STANDING"
    data4$activity[data4$activity == 6] <- "LAYING"
