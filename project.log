What is the training set?
Waht is the data set?

Both answers in important_info.log.

Moving in for the merge now.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Data appears to be in the format of space-seperated values


train/y_train.txt has 7352 rows
train/x_train.txt has 7352 rows 

each row has a bunch of values.  561 to be exact!
Each row is an activity.

I know what I need to do.

First I am going to start off by seeing if I can do everything that I need to do with just the first fifty rows of each file.

I am going to start by merging "vertically" and then trying to merge horizontally.

Starting with the readings vector.
  two steps:
    1.  merge 50 + 100
    2.  statistical transform to stdev and mean




    #SUBJECTS
      subjects1 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test_50.txt")
      subjects2 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train_100.txt")

      data_table_1 = rbind(subjects1, subjects2)

      library(plyr)
      data_table_1 = rename(data_table_1,c("V1"="subject_id"))

    #ACTIVITIES

      activities1 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test_50.txt")
      activities2 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train_100.txt")
      activities3 = rbind(activities1,activities2)


      data_table_1 = cbind(data_table_1, activities3)
      data_table_1 = rename(data_table_1,c("V1"="activity_id"))


      data_table_1$activity_id[data_table_1$activity_id == 1] <- "WALKING"
      data_table_1$activity_id[data_table_1$activity_id == 2] <- "WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
      data_table_1$activity_id[data_table_1$activity_id == 3] <- "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
      data_table_1$activity_id[data_table_1$activity_id == 4] <- "SITTING"
      data_table_1$activity_id[data_table_1$activity_id == 5] <- "STANDING"
      data_table_1$activity_id[data_table_1$activity_id == 6] <- "LAYING"

    #DATA
      data1 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test_50.txt")
      data2 = read.table("~/Desktop/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train_100.txt")
      data3 = rbind(data1,data2)


      data_table_1$mean = rowMeans(data3)
      data_table_1$stdev = apply(data3,1,sd)



    #RESHAPING DATA
      library(reshape)
      mdata <- melt(data_table_1, id=c("subject_id","activity_id"))


      reshaped_Data <- cast(mdata, subject_id + activity_id~variable, mean)
